üèí NHL Data Science Roadmap ‚Äî From Regression to Advanced Stats

OVERVIEW
A compact roadmap to take your NHL analytics project from basic regression to a final capstone.
Each milestone lists focus areas, deliverables, and a suggested short LinkedIn-style post.

------------------------------------------------------------
MILESTONE 1 ‚Äî Linear Regression: Player & Team Performance
Focus:
- Player: Predict points_per_game using shots, time_on_ice_per_game, shooting_percentage.
- Team: Predict points or goals_for using goals_against, shots_for, etc. from seasons_end_standings.

Deliverable:
- Scatterplots with regression lines (player & team level).
- Key coefficients table (e.g., shots ‚Üí points).

LinkedIn post idea:
- Title: ‚ÄúWhich stats drive NHL player and team success?‚Äù
- Caption: Used regression to understand how shooting volume impacts scoring ‚Äî efficiency matters, but attempts dominate.
------------------------------------------------------------
MILESTONE 2 ‚Äî Logistic Regression: Shot Success & Game Outcomes
Focus:
- Player: Predict goal probability from events (x/y coords, shot type).
- Team: Predict win probability per game using home_score, away_score, shots, goalie_in_net_id.

Deliverable:
- ROC curve or confusion matrix for the team win model.
- Rink heatmap of shot success zones.

LinkedIn post idea:
- Title: ‚ÄúPredicting NHL game outcomes and goal probabilities.‚Äù
- Caption: Shot distance and home advantage are strong predictors.
------------------------------------------------------------
MILESTONE 3 ‚Äî Hypothesis Testing & ANOVA
Focus:
- Player: Compare shooting % across positions or handedness.
- Team: Compare team points across divisions or conferences.

Deliverable:
- Boxplots by division or conference.
- ANOVA summary with p-values.

LinkedIn post idea:
- Title: ‚ÄúAre some divisions statistically stronger than others?‚Äù
- Caption: Example: tested league parity ‚Äî Western Conference teams showed no significant point differences.
------------------------------------------------------------
MILESTONE 4 ‚Äî Time-Series & Trend Modeling
Focus:
- Player: Track and model player performance year-over-year.
- Team: Model trends in team offensive/defensive efficiency (e.g., GF/GA ratio across seasons).

Deliverable:
- Multi-year line charts and rolling averages.
- Short-horizon forecast examples.

LinkedIn post idea:
- Title: ‚ÄúHow NHL teams evolve over time: performance trend analysis.‚Äù
- Caption: Teams improving defensive consistency tend to sustain playoff success longer.
------------------------------------------------------------
MILESTONE 5 ‚Äî Hierarchical / Mixed-Effects Models
Focus:
- Player: Include team-level random effects in scoring models.
- Team: Model win rate with season-level random effects.

Deliverable:
- Visual of random-effect variance (team-level impact).
- Discussion of player vs team variance share.

LinkedIn post idea:
- Title: ‚ÄúHow much do team effects influence player scoring?‚Äù
- Caption: Example: hierarchical model ‚Äî ~18% of scoring variance attributed to team context.
------------------------------------------------------------
MILESTONE 6 ‚Äî Generalized Linear Models (Counts & Rates)
Focus:
- Player: Poisson model for goals or penalty_minutes.
- Team: Poisson/Negative Binomial model for team goals_for or wins.

Deliverable:
- Observed vs predicted counts and diagnostics.
- Notes on overdispersion and model fit.

LinkedIn post idea:
- Title: ‚ÄúModeling goal and win counts in the NHL.‚Äù
- Caption: Poisson regression shows offense and possession metrics drive scoring.
------------------------------------------------------------
MILESTONE 7 ‚Äî Model Comparison & RegularIZATION
Focus:
- Player: Compare OLS, Ridge, and Lasso for predicting points.
- Team: Compare models predicting total season points.

Deliverable:
- Comparison table (R¬≤, RMSE, AIC).
- Bar chart of feature coefficients and stability across models.

LinkedIn post idea:
- Title: ‚ÄúTesting different statistical models to predict NHL performance.‚Äù
- Caption: Regularization helps identify key stats without overfitting.
------------------------------------------------------------
MILESTONE 8 ‚Äî Light ML Extension
Focus:
- Player: Random forest predicting all-star selection (if label available).
- Team: Random forest predicting playoff qualification.

Deliverable:
- Feature importance plots.
- ROC/accuracy summary.

LinkedIn post idea:
- Title: ‚ÄúUsing machine learning to predict playoff qualification.‚Äù
- Caption: Shot differential and goals against are top predictors.
------------------------------------------------------------
MILESTONE 9 ‚Äî Final Capstone: ‚ÄúWhat Drives NHL Success?‚Äù
Focus:
- Combine player + team analyses into a single narrative project.
- Use regression, ANOVA, mixed models, and a light ML model.

Deliverable:
- Final report with visuals and code.
- GitHub/portfolio link and a short post/thread of findings.

LinkedIn post series (example):
1) Data overview & cleaning pipeline
2) Player models & key findings
3) Team models & trends over time
4) Full insights with repo link
------------------------------------------------------------
QUICK IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
- Start each milestone with a reproducible notebook containing:
  - Data extraction & cleaning
  - EDA plots (static + interactive)
  - Minimal model code and evaluation
- Reuse feature-engineering and CV utilities across milestones.
- Keep artifacts small, reproducible, and self-contained for sharing.
